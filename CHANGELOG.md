## [0.0.3] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- Multi-language support (English and French and Spanish) — English is the default.
- Changelog dialog (this file's in-app counterpart) — accessible from the sidebar.
- "View Changelog" button under the Settings button.
- `i18n.py` module with a full translation system (`t()`, `set_language()`, `get_language()`).

### Changed
- Redesigned the Settings dialog with clearer sections (Appearance, Language, GitHub & Updates).
- Redesigned the update-check result dialog with a polished, consistent interface.
- Icons in the Settings dialog now correctly follow the active theme color (fixes white icons on the light theme).
- The Settings dialog now updates its texts and icons immediately when the language or theme is changed, without needing to close and reopen it.

### Fixed
- Icons in Settings were always rendered in white regardless of the active theme.
